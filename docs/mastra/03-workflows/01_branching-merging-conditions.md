# Control Flow
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/workflows/control-flow

When you build a workflow, you typically break down operations into smaller tasks that can be linked and reused. **Steps** provide a structured way to manage these tasks by defining inputs, outputs, and execution logic.

- If the schemas match, the `outputSchema` from each step is automatically passed to the `inputSchema` of the next step.
- If the schemas don't match, use [Input data mapping](./input-data-mapping.mdx) to transform the `outputSchema` into the expected `inputSchema`.

## Chaining steps with `.then()`

Chain steps to execute sequentially using `.then()`:

![Chaining steps with .then()](/image/workflows/workflows-control-flow-then.jpg)

```typescript {8-9,4-5} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const step1 = createStep({...});
const step2 = createStep({...});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .then(step1)
  .then(step2)
  .commit();
```

This does what you'd expect: it executes `step1`, then it executes `step2`.

## Simultaneous steps with `.parallel()`

Execute steps simultaneously using `.parallel()`:

![Concurrent steps with .parallel()](/image/workflows/workflows-control-flow-parallel.jpg)

```typescript {9,4-5} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const step1 = createStep({...});
const step2 = createStep({...});
const step3 = createStep({...});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .parallel([step1, step2])
  .then(step3)
  .commit();
```

This executes `step1` and `step2` concurrently, then continues to `step3` after both complete.

## Conditional logic with `.branch()`

Execute steps conditionally using `.branch()`:

![Conditional branching with .branch()](/image/workflows/workflows-control-flow-branch.jpg)

```typescript {8-11,4-5} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const lessThanStep = createStep({...});
const greaterThanStep = createStep({...});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .branch([
    [async ({ inputData: { value } }) => value <= 10, lessThanStep],
    [async ({ inputData: { value } }) => value > 10, greaterThanStep]
  ])
  .commit();
```

Branch conditions are evaluated sequentially, but steps with matching conditions are executed in parallel.

## Looping steps

Workflows support two types of loops. When looping a step, or any step-compatible construct like a nested workflow, the initial `inputData` is sourced from the output of the previous step.

To ensure compatibility, the loop’s initial input must either match the shape of the previous step’s output, or be explicitly transformed using the `map` function.

- Match the shape of the previous step’s output, or
- Be explicitly transformed using the `map` function.

### Repeating with `.dowhile()`

Executes step repeatedly while a condition is true.

![Repeating with .dowhile()](/image/workflows/workflows-control-flow-dowhile.jpg)

```typescript {7} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const counterStep = createStep({...});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .dowhile(counterStep, async ({ inputData: { number } }) => number < 10)
  .commit();
```

### Repeating with `.dountil()`

Executes step repeatedly until a condition becomes true.

![Repeating with .dountil()](/image/workflows/workflows-control-flow-dountil.jpg)

```typescript {7} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const counterStep = createStep({...});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .dountil(counterStep, async ({ inputData: { number } }) => number > 10)
  .commit();
```

### Loop management

Loop conditions can be implemented in different ways depending on how you want the loop to end. Common patterns include checking values returned in `inputData`, setting a maximum number of iterations, or aborting execution when a limit is reached.

#### Conditional loops

The `inputData` for a loop step is the output of a previous step. Use the values in `inputData` to determine whether the loop should continue or stop.

```typescript {7} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const counterStep = createStep({...});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
.dountil(nestedWorkflowStep, async ({ inputData: { userResponse } }) => userResponse === "yes")
.commit();
```

#### Limiting loops

The `iterationCount` tracks how many times the loop step has run. You can use this to limit the number of iterations and prevent infinite loops. Combine it with `inputData` values to stop the loop after a set number of attempts.

```typescript {7} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const counterStep = createStep({...});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
.dountil(nestedWorkflowStep, async ({ inputData: { userResponse, iterationCount } }) => userResponse === "yes" || iterationCount >= 10)
.commit();
```

#### Aborting loops

Use `iterationCount` to limit how many times a loop runs. If the count exceeds your threshold, throw an error to fail the step and stop the workflow.

```typescript {7} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const counterStep = createStep({...});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
.dountil(nestedWorkflowStep, async ({ inputData: { userResponse, iterationCount } }) => {
  if (iterationCount >= 10) {
    throw new Error("Maximum iterations reached");
  }
  return userResponse === "yes";
})
.commit();
```

### Repeating with `.foreach()`

Sequentially executes the same step for each item from the `inputSchema`.

![Repeating with .foreach()](/image/workflows/workflows-control-flow-foreach.jpg)

```typescript {7} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const mapStep = createStep({...});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .foreach(mapStep)
  .commit();
```

#### Setting concurrency limits

Use `concurrency` to execute steps in parallel with a limit on the number of concurrent executions.

```typescript {7} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const mapStep = createStep({...})

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .foreach(mapStep, { concurrency: 2 })
  .commit();
```

## Using a nested workflow

Use a nested workflow as a step by passing it to `.then()`. This runs each of its steps in sequence as part of the parent workflow.

```typescript {4,7} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

export const nestedWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .then(nestedWorkflow)
  .commit();
```

## Cloning a workflow

Use `cloneWorkflow` to duplicate an existing workflow. This lets you reuse its structure while overriding parameters like `id`.

```typescript {6,10} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep, cloneWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const step1 = createStep({...});
const parentWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
const clonedWorkflow = cloneWorkflow(parentWorkflow, { id: "cloned-workflow" });

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .then(step1)
  .then(clonedWorkflow)
  .commit();
```

## Example Run Instance

The following example demonstrates how to start a run with multiple inputs. Each input will pass through the `mapStep` sequentially.

```typescript {6} filename="src/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { mastra } from "./mastra";

const run = await mastra.getWorkflow("testWorkflow").createRunAsync();

const result = await run.start({
  inputData: [{ number: 10 }, { number: 100 }, { number: 200 }]
});
```

To execute this run from your terminal:

```bash copy
npx tsx src/test-workflow.ts
```
