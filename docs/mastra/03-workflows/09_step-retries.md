# Step Retries
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/legacyWorkflows/step-retries

Mastra provides built-in retry mechanisms to handle transient failures in workflow steps. This allows workflows to recover gracefully from temporary issues without requiring manual intervention.

## Overview

When a step in a workflow fails (throws an exception), Mastra can automatically retry the step execution based on a configurable retry policy. This is useful for handling:

- Network connectivity issues
- Service unavailability
- Rate limiting
- Temporary resource constraints
- Other transient failures

## Default Behavior

By default, steps do not retry when they fail. This means:

- A step will execute once
- If it fails, it will immediately mark the step as failed
- The workflow will continue to execute any subsequent steps that don't depend on the failed step

## Configuration Options

Retries can be configured at two levels:

### 1. Workflow-level Configuration

You can set a default retry configuration for all steps in a workflow:

```typescript
const workflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "my-workflow",
  retryConfig: {
    attempts: 3, // Number of retries (in addition to the initial attempt)
    delay: 1000, // Delay between retries in milliseconds
  },
});
```

### 2. Step-level Configuration

You can also configure retries on individual steps, which will override the workflow-level configuration for that specific step:

```typescript
const fetchDataStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "fetchData",
  execute: async () => {
    // Fetch data from external API
  },
  retryConfig: {
    attempts: 5, // This step will retry up to 5 times
    delay: 2000, // With a 2-second delay between retries
  },
});
```

## Retry Parameters

The `retryConfig` object supports the following parameters:

| Parameter  | Type   | Default | Description                                                       |
| ---------- | ------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `attempts` | number | 0       | The number of retry attempts (in addition to the initial attempt) |
| `delay`    | number | 1000    | Time in milliseconds to wait between retries                      |

## How Retries Work

When a step fails, Mastra's retry mechanism:

1. Checks if the step has retry attempts remaining
2. If attempts remain:
   - Decrements the attempt counter
   - Transitions the step to a "waiting" state
   - Waits for the configured delay period
   - Retries the step execution
3. If no attempts remain or all attempts have been exhausted:
   - Marks the step as "failed"
   - Continues workflow execution (for steps that don't depend on the failed step)

During retry attempts, the workflow execution remains active but paused for the specific step that is being retried.

## Examples

### Basic Retry Example

```typescript
import { LegacyWorkflow, LegacyStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";

// Define a step that might fail
const unreliableApiStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "callUnreliableApi",
  execute: async () => {
    // Simulate an API call that might fail
    const random = Math.random();
    if (random < 0.7) {
      throw new Error("API call failed");
    }
    return { data: "API response data" };
  },
  retryConfig: {
    attempts: 3, // Retry up to 3 times
    delay: 2000, // Wait 2 seconds between attempts
  },
});

// Create a workflow with the unreliable step
const workflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "retry-demo-workflow",
});

workflow.step(unreliableApiStep).then(processResultStep).commit();
```

### Workflow-level Retries with Step Override

```typescript
import { LegacyWorkflow, LegacyStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";

// Create a workflow with default retry configuration
const workflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "multi-retry-workflow",
  retryConfig: {
    attempts: 2, // All steps will retry twice by default
    delay: 1000, // With a 1-second delay
  },
});

// This step uses the workflow's default retry configuration
const standardStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "standardStep",
  execute: async () => {
    // Some operation that might fail
  },
});

// This step overrides the workflow's retry configuration
const criticalStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "criticalStep",
  execute: async () => {
    // Critical operation that needs more retry attempts
  },
  retryConfig: {
    attempts: 5, // Override with 5 retry attempts
    delay: 5000, // And a longer 5-second delay
  },
});

// This step disables retries
const noRetryStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "noRetryStep",
  execute: async () => {
    // Operation that should not retry
  },
  retryConfig: {
    attempts: 0, // Explicitly disable retries
  },
});

workflow.step(standardStep).then(criticalStep).then(noRetryStep).commit();
```

## Monitoring Retries

You can monitor retry attempts in your logs. Mastra logs retry-related events at the `debug` level:

```
[DEBUG] Step fetchData failed (runId: abc-123)
[DEBUG] Attempt count for step fetchData: 2 remaining attempts (runId: abc-123)
[DEBUG] Step fetchData waiting (runId: abc-123)
[DEBUG] Step fetchData finished waiting (runId: abc-123)
[DEBUG] Step fetchData pending (runId: abc-123)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Retries for Transient Failures**: Only configure retries for operations that might experience transient failures. For deterministic errors (like validation failures), retries won't help.

2. **Set Appropriate Delays**: Consider using longer delays for external API calls to allow time for services to recover.

3. **Limit Retry Attempts**: Don't set extremely high retry counts as this could cause workflows to run for excessive periods during outages.

4. **Implement Idempotent Operations**: Ensure your step's `execute` function is idempotent (can be called multiple times without side effects) since it may be retried.

5. **Consider Backoff Strategies**: For more advanced scenarios, consider implementing exponential backoff in your step's logic for operations that might be rate-limited.
