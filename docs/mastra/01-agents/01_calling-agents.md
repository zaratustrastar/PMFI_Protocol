# Calling Agents
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/agents/calling-agents

There are multiple ways to interact with agents created using Mastra. Below you will find examples of how to call agents using workflow steps, tools, the [Mastra Client SDK](../../docs/server-db/mastra-client.mdx), and the command line for quick local testing.

This page demonstrates how to call the `harryPotterAgent` described in the [Changing the System Prompt](./system-prompt.mdx) example.

## From a workflow step

The `mastra` instance is passed as an argument to a workflow step’s `execute` function. It provides access to registered agents using `getAgent()`. Use this method to retrieve your agent, then call `generate()` with a prompt.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const step1 = createStep({
  // ...
  execute: async ({ mastra }) => {

    const agent = mastra.getAgent("harryPotterAgent");
    const response = await agent.generate("What is your favorite room in Hogwarts?");

    console.log(response.text);
  }
});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  // ...
})
  .then(step1)
  .commit();
```

## From a tool

The `mastra` instance is available within a tool’s `execute` function. Use `getAgent()` to retrieve a registered agent and call `generate()` with a prompt.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/tools/test-tool.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createTool } from "@mastra/core/tools";
import { z } from "zod";

export const testTool = createTool({
  // ...
  execute: async ({ mastra }) => {

    const agent = mastra.getAgent("harryPotterAgent");
    const response = await agent.generate("What is your favorite room in Hogwarts?");

    console.log(response!.text);
  }
});
```

## From Mastra Client

The `mastraClient` instance provides access to registered agents. Use `getAgent()` to retrieve an agent and call `generate()` with an object containing a `messages` array of role/content pairs.

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
import { mastraClient } from "../lib/mastra-client";

const agent = mastraClient.getAgent("harryPotterAgent");
const response = await agent.generate({
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "What is your favorite room in Hogwarts?"
    }
  ]
});

console.log(response.text);
```

> See [Mastra Client SDK](../../docs/server-db/mastra-client.mdx) for more information.

### Run the script

Run this script from your command line using:

```bash
npx tsx src/test-agent.ts
```

## Using HTTP or curl

You can interact with a registered agent by sending a `POST` request to your Mastra application's `/generate` endpoint. Include a `messages` array of role/content pairs.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4111/api/agents/harryPotterAgent/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What is your favorite room in Hogwarts?"
      }
    ]
  }'| jq -r '.text'
```


## Example output

```text
Well, if I had to choose, I'd say the Gryffindor common room.
It's where I've spent some of my best moments with Ron and Hermione.
The warm fire, the cozy armchairs, and the sense of camaraderie make it feel like home.
Plus, it's where we plan all our adventures!
```
