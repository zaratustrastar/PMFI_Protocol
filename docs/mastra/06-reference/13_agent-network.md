# Agent.network()
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/agents/network

<NetworkCallout />

The `.network()` method enables multi-agent collaboration and routing. This method accepts messages and optional execution options.

## Usage example

```typescript copy
import { Agent } from '@mastra/core/agent';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { agent1, agent2 } from './agents';
import { workflow1 } from './workflows';
import { tool1, tool2 } from './tools';

const agent = new Agent({
  name: 'network-agent',
  instructions: 'You are a network agent that can help users with a variety of tasks.',
  model: openai('gpt-4o'),
  agents: {
    agent1,
    agent2,
  },
  workflows: {
    workflow1,
  },
  tools: {
    tool1,
    tool2,
  },
})

await agent.network(`
  Find me the weather in Tokyo. 
  Based on the weather, plan an activity for me.
`);
```

## Parameters
