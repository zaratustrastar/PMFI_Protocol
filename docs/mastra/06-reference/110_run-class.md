# Run Class
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/workflows/run

The `Run` class represents a workflow execution instance, providing methods to start, resume, stream, and monitor workflow execution.

## Usage example

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
const run = await workflow.createRunAsync();

const result = await run.start({
  inputData: { value: "initial data" }
});

if (result.status === "suspended") {
  const resumedResult = await run.resume({
    resumeData: { value: "resume data" }
  });
}
```

## Run Methods

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "start",
      type: "(options?: StartOptions) => Promise<WorkflowResult>",
      description: "Starts workflow execution with input data",
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: "resume",
      type: "(options?: ResumeOptions) => Promise<WorkflowResult>",
      description: "Resumes a suspended workflow from a specific step",
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: "stream",
      type: "(options?: StreamOptions) => Promise<StreamResult>",
      description: "Monitors workflow execution as a stream of events",
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: "streamVNext",
      type: "(options?: StreamOptions) => MastraWorkflowStream",
      description: "Enables real-time streaming with enhanced features",
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: "watch",
      type: "(callback: WatchCallback, type?: WatchType) => UnwatchFunction",
      description: "Monitors workflow execution with callback-based events",
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: "cancel",
      type: "() => Promise<void>",
      description: "Cancels the workflow execution",
      required: true,
    }
  ]}
/>

## Run Status

A workflow run's `status` indicates its current execution state. The possible values are:

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "success",
      type: "string",
      description:
        "All steps finished executing successfully, with a valid result output",
    },
    {
      name: "failed",
      type: "string",
      description:
        "Workflow execution encountered an error during execution, with error details available",
    },
    {
      name: "suspended",
      type: "string",
      description:
        "Workflow execution is paused waiting for resume, with suspended step information",
    },
  ]}
/>
