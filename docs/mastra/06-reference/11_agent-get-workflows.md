# Agent.getWorkflows()
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/agents/getWorkflows

The `.getWorkflows()` method retrieves the workflows configured for an agent, resolving them if they're a function. These workflows enable the agent to execute complex, multi-step processes with defined execution paths.

## Usage example

```typescript copy
await agent.getWorkflows();
```

## Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "options",
      type: "{ runtimeContext?: RuntimeContext }",
      isOptional: true,
      defaultValue: "{}",
      description: "Optional configuration object containing runtime context.",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Returns

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "workflows",
      type: "Promise<Record<string, Workflow>>",
      description: "A promise that resolves to a record of workflow names to their corresponding Workflow instances.",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Extended usage example

```typescript copy
await agent.getWorkflows({
  runtimeContext: new RuntimeContext()
});
```

### Options parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "runtimeContext",
      type: "RuntimeContext",
      isOptional: true,
      defaultValue: "new RuntimeContext()",
      description: "Runtime context for dependency injection and contextual information.",
    },
  ]}
/>
